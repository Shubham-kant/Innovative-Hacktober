he simplest form of disk scheduling is, of course, the first-come, first-served
(FCFS) algorithm. This algorithm is intrinsically fair, but it generally does not
provide the fastest service. Consider, for example, a disk queue with requests
for I/O to blocks on cylinders
98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67,
in that order. If the disk head is initially at cylinder 53, it will first move from
53 to 98, then to 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, and finally to 67, for a total head
movement of 640 cylinders. This schedule is diagrammed in Fig
